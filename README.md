# Chat application

Chat is an application built on WebSocket. You can use it to chat with your friends: just enter your name and choose or create a new chat room. 

I created this chat during Node.js course by [Andrew Mead](https://github.com/andrewjmead).

## Getting Started

This project is [deployed](https://maximenko-node-chat-app.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku so you can check it right now. 

In case you want to run this repository on your machine, please download it, download all needed npm packages using `npm i` and hit `npm run dev`, so the project will be running on your localhost.
